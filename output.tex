What are the expectations that you have of this class?

\begin{itemize}
\item 
In this class, I expect myself to dive deeper into mathematics. Multivariable Calculus is one of the fundamental courses of math and used in engineering and computer science. I also hope I can build onto of what I learn in Calculus BC.

\end{itemize}



Do you have a job now? What do you do and how many hours do you work?

\begin{itemize}
\item 
I currently do not have a job.

\end{itemize}



What are some of your hobbies? What is your major?

\begin{itemize}
\item 
In my free time, I like to code software and make various gadgets that interact with computers in some way. My current planned major is Undeclared Engineering, but I am mainly interested in Computer Science, Computer Engineering, Mechanical Engineering, Electrical engineering, and Aerospace Engineering

\end{itemize}

Share something interesting about yourself. 

\begin{itemize}
\item 
I’m currently developing software that lets you create professional documents in seconds. In fact, I’m using it to write this All About Me card.
